# Neyman Construction
For this homework, I used a rayleigh distribution to construct a Neyman Construction plot of a given parameter. Due to runtime constraints, I only used 1000 experiments for every mu_true, but the shape of the resulting observable can be seen, and is as expected from a rayleigh distribution.
