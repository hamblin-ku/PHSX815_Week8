# Neyman Construction
For this homework, I used a rayleigh distribution to construct a Neyman Construction plot of a given parameter. Due to runtime constraints, I only used 1000 experiments for every mu_true, but the shape of the resulting observable can be seen, and is as expected from a rayleigh distribution. 

# Homework 9
 I chose to use the `fmin` and `fminbound` functions in  `scipy.optimize`. I found the two minima for a simple function f(x) = x^2 + 10*sin(x) on the interval [-10,10]. The code is found in `minimize.py`.

# Homework 10
I used `scipy.optimize.minimize`  to find the minima of f(x,y) = x**2 + y**2. I plotted the function and showed the minimum. The code is in `homework10.py` and the plot can be seen in `homework10.png`.
